# This will be my future website

This is the simple app Dan North put together as the demo for [his talk at GOTO Aarhus 2012][1]. I am adapting his code to study and build upon to make my website.

To run it you'll need a recent version of node 0.8. I've been using [n][2] so installing is as simple as setting `N_PREFIX` and adding `$N_PREFIX/bin` to your path. Then you run:

    % n 0.8.21

which will install and enable that version. (Try `n list` to see which versions are available.)
